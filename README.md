# Learning-TodoList
All code in this repor is referenced from https://github.com/sdaityari/to-do-list
The code is modified for my learning purpose only.

#Modifications:
- remove Bootstrap (I don't like bootstrap)
- remove Clear Data button and its function (useless function - I think so)
- add Owner info and display it in the same row with date info, also same format
- add collapse function for all boxes (To Do, In Progress, Completed, Add A Task)
